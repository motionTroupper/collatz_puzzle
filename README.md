# Collatz Puzzle

A visual and interactive exploration of the Collatz conjecture through bitwise patterns and arithmetic transformations.

## Overview

This project delves into the Collatz conjecture by analyzing binary representations and their transformations. It offers a unique perspective by visualizing how numbers evolve under the Collatz process, emphasizing the role of bit patterns in determining the sequence's behavior.

## Features

- **Interactive Puzzle**: A PowerPoint presentation (`collatz_puzzle.pptx`) that visually demonstrates the Collatz transformations.
- **Analytical Tools**: Python scripts that compute and analyze the Collatz sequences, highlighting patterns and anomalies.
- **Educational Resource**: Designed to aid in understanding the underlying mechanics of the Collatz conjecture through visual and computational means.

## Getting Started
